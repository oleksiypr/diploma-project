# diploma-project
This is my diploma project. The aim of this project was to create framework by means of principles of Reactive and Functional programming in
Scala to be used for simulation of computer systems.  This framework represents DSL for computer system simulations (something like VHDL).
Framework was developed based on event-driven model. As a concept Mili Automate had been simulated and one's work investigated against theoretical analysis and expectations.
